        1.Use KVL on the 2 loops to find current at point a:<br>
        Loop1:<br>

        loop2:I1 should be clockwise mb.<br>

        System of equations:<br>

        2.Use that current to find voltage at point 'a' because that is the open circuit voltage part of the thevenin circuit<br>
        <img src="image/5.4-4.4.png"><br>
        upon examination, we find that the voltage at point 'a' in the orginal circuit, or Voc is the voltage of the 18V source minus the voltage drop across the 12 ohm resistor. Voc=12v<br>
    
        3.Close the circuit and find equivalent resistance of that circuit. (resistance if it was connected to something). replace voltage sources with short circuits to do this.<br>

        we have a circuit in parallel and in series. to simplify it we notice that the bottom half of the circuit is messy. a ten ohm resistor encounters a 6 ohm and a 3 ohm resistor in parallel. we can get the equivalent resistance of the 6 and 3 ohm in parallel using product over sum, and then place that equivilent resistance in series with the 10 ohm resistor. then we have two 12 ohm resistors in parallel as a result. Req/Rth=6 ohms.<br>
        4. Create the circuit: we have Voc=12V, and Rth=6 ohms.<br>
